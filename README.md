# php_login_test

the following files are empty:
login.php
logout.inc.hp
footer.php

the code allows the user to sign up to the db and should allow the user to login in to the same db

u will need to create ur own db and change the 'dbName' in the php code in 'dbh.inc.php' to urs, or, u use the same name as mine, "loginsystem-test1"
